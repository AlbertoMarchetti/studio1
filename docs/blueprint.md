- Accent color: HSL 180, 54%, 40% (RGB #32A893) used sparingly for secondary actions or highlights.
- Use a clean, sans-serif font such as 'Roboto' or 'Lato' for readability and a modern look.
- Incorporate simple, line-based icons from a library like Material Design Icons to maintain a clean and consistent visual language.
- Employ rounded corners and subtle shadows for elements to create depth and a user-friendly interface.
